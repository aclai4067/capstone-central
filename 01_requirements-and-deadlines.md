* It is NOT required to use an external API.

##### Planning:

* If you are using an external API, gather all sample data and be prepared to demo your api at your first checkin (via axios call - use the first react project we made) before committing to use the API.
* If you have not fleshed out your planning enough, your capstone mentor will not let you code.

##### Project NoNos:
