# Coding Schedule

* You may start coding when your capstone mentor is satisfied with your preparation verbally tells you that you may start coding.
* The first official day for coding is Monday 12/4/2017.  If you do not have permission to start coding by this monday you are behind.


### Instructors Available:
Once coding starts instructors will be available to help you at these days and time:

**Week 1:**
* Monday 12/4/2017 5-9:30pm
* Tuesday 12/5/2017 5-9:30pm
* Wednesday 12/6/2017 5-9:30pm
* Thursday 12/7/2017 5-9:30pm
* Saturday 12/9/2017 9am-2pm

**Week 2:**
* Monday 12/11/2017 5-9:30pm
* Tuesday 12/12/2017 5-9:30pm
* Wednesday 12/13/2017 5-9:30pm
* Thursday 12/14/2017 5-9:30pm
* Saturday 12/16/2017 9am-2pm

**Week 3 - MVP demos:**
* Monday 12/18/2017 5-9:30pm
* Tuesday 12/19/2017 5-9:30pm


### Expectations:
* If your mentor is in we expect you to be too.
* If you are not in on one of the above days we expect a standup (what you did yesterday, what you are going to do today) to be delivered via slack before 7pm.
* If you are not at school but have questions do not expect us to be looking at slack - we get VERY busy during capstone time. Students who are present at school will get priority over slack questions.
* We will be spending most of week 3 listening to MVP demo's from students so we won't have a TON of time to help durring those two nights.
